# ==============================================================================
# ðŸš¨ A QUICK WORD OF WARNING FOR ANYONE LOOKING THROUGH THIS FILE:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This yabai config was cobbled together by looking at what a bunch of other
# folks have done, understanding very little of it, and copy-pasting until I
# reached an end result that made me feel like a cool hacker.
#
# Itâ€™s worth noting that a lot of the yabai stuff is controlled via keyboard
# shortcuts, so make sure you check out `../skhd/skhdrc` for the rest of the 
# yabai setup.
#
# Those looking for clarity will not find it here.
# ==============================================================================


# There are some shortcuts that switch between desktop spaces and move focus
# around, and for some reason they only work if you enable this setting on
# startup. You have to set your system to allow `sudo yabai` without a password,
# though, so make sure to read the full setup instructions so this works:

# If you want yabai to stop touching your stuff, you can use rules like these to
